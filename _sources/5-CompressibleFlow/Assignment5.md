# Assignment 5. A function to compute the flow after a deflection angle

Write a function, say `OSWFlow(U1,theta,T1, p1, theta)`, that gives for the flow 1 entering a deflection angle $\theta$, the characteristics of the flow after the OSW.  That is:

- Is there an OSW?
- $\text{Ma}_1$ and $\text{Ma}_2$
- Angle of the OSW ($\beta$)
- Flow conditions after the OSW: $u_2$, $T_2$ and $p_2$

Don't forget to properly document the function.
